# 📝 JavaScript, TypeScript Dev Note

## 📘 Why am I writing this note?

- This will be my cheat sheet.
  - Therefore, it will contain only the things which I think are **important to remember** or **easy to forget**.
  - There will be a **simple explanation** of the concepts with **examples**.
  - And maybe **tips** or **guide** if necessary.
- This will also be my DB for JS/TS Development.
  - My **custom settings** for JS/TS Development will be here.
